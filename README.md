# Photography Portfolio README

### What is this?
This is a personal project of mine I took up while chatting with a friend about their photography.  They needed a site done to showcase all of their work, so I took it on because I thought it would be great practice to have a client-based project where I can check in with them through all of the different stages.

I really wanted to sharpen up my Front-End skills without being dependent of any gems/plug ins, so I tried to do most of everything from scratch!  I learned a TON during this project.  The two gems I did use were for back-end features, and I only used those because I've actually written all of that same functionality on my own from scratch on a different [project](https://github.com/benjaminhyw/rails-online-shop).  I feel comfortable enough with my code that I thought it would be fine to use gems for those parts, since that wasn't my main focus for this project.  I am so glad this opportunity opened up both for me and my friend and I'm very happy with the results!

Here's a list of all of the requested/specified features, all of which have been achieved or are close to being finished.

This was all written in Ruby/Rails(5.0.2) / HTML / CSS / JavaScript (jQuery)

* Single-Page Flexbox Responsive Design
* Horizontal scroll for images
* Modal image pop up (when clicking on image)
* Infinite Pagination (AJAX)
* Smooth transition animation effects (JS/CSS)
  * Nav Bar changes colors after scrolling a specified amount
  * Images fade in when scrolled to the appropriate spot
  * Vertical scroll when clicking downwards arrow/Nav bar name
  * Fade surrounding area when hovering over downwards arrow
* GIF/MP4 background on page load
* Administrative back end ([Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) && [rails_admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin))


### What's next?
This project could definitely use some cleaning up.  So, that comes next.  Essentially all major functionality for the application is set, so unless my client asks for more features I think I'm ready to move forward with the finishing touches.  However, I firmly believe there's always room for improvement so I'll actively be on the lookout!
